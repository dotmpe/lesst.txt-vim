Lesst.txt-vim
=============
A syntax (color highlighting) script for ``*.list`` files with a particular format.

The aim; a format for user/meta data that:

- holds lines of tabular, numerically encoded data followed by free-form values
- somewhat readable but mostly editable and compact
- supports comments, certain preprocessing directives, and line-continuations.
- allows for multiline and preformatted parts that are still readable by a line processor.
- can use comments for file and block-level metadata

Status
------
[2022-08-10] Initial Vim syntax file.
